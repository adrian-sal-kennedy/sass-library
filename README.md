# sass-library
just somewhere to put my sass and css noodlings so i can use them anywhere.

I will also put an install.sh in here, which really just creates a shell script called /usr/local/bin/link-sass that symlinks this folder to where it is run from.  
This is useful because any change that happens here will be available in the site you link it to as well (good or bad).
